### Changes

Critical fix for date sensor format error that was preventing coordinator from completing successfully.

Urgent date format fixes:
• Fixed ValueError in date sensors causing coordinator to fail silently
• Next Bill Date sensor now properly converts "20 Oct 2025" to "2025-10-20" format
• Next Read Date sensor now properly converts "17 Oct 2025" to "2025-10-17" format  
• Last Read Date sensor now properly converts "19 Sep 2025" to "2025-09-19" format
• Added error handling for unparseable dates with warning logs
• Fixed Home Assistant date device class compatibility (isoformat requirement)

This release resolves the coordinator data flow issue - the coordinator was working correctly but failing due to date format errors, preventing sensors from receiving the successfully fetched API data.
