### Changes

• Chart sensors now use the recommended Home Assistant database executor for statistics queries
• Fixes warning: 'Detected code that accesses the database without the database executor'

### Technical Details
- Replaced hass.async_add_executor_job(statistics_during_period, ...) with recorder.get_instance(hass).async_add_executor_job(...)
- Ensures async safety and performance for database access

### User Impact
- No more Home Assistant warnings about unsafe database access
- Improved reliability and compatibility for future Home Assistant versions
