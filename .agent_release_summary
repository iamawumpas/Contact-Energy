### Changes

Fixed sensor data access by mapping to correct Contact Energy API response structure.

Critical fixes:
• Fixed coordinator data flow - sensors were receiving empty data despite successful API calls
• Mapped all sensors to correct Contact Energy API response fields based on actual API structure
• Account Balance: accountDetail.accountBalance.currentBalance  
• Customer Name: accountDetail.nickname
• Account Number: accountDetail.id
• Service Address: contracts[].premise.supplyAddress.shortForm
• Meter Serial: contracts[].devices[0].serialNumber
• Next Read Date: contracts[].devices[0].nextMeterReadDate
• Last Read Date: contracts[].devices[0].registers[0].previousMeterReadingDate
• Next Bill: accountDetail.nextBill.amount and .date
• Last Payment: accountDetail.payments[0].amount (with $ parsing)
• Enhanced debugging and error handling throughout data access paths

This release should resolve the "Unknown" values in account information sensors by properly accessing the Contact Energy API response structure.
