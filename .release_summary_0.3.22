### Changes

- API resilience: Map frequent upstream 502s to CannotConnect (transient) instead of UnknownError, improving retry behavior and reducing noise
- Coordinator robustness: Mark update failed when `accountDetail` is missing/empty so account sensors show `unavailable` rather than blank values
- Thread-safety: Use an async callback for the daily restart scheduler to eliminate "coroutine was never awaited" and thread warnings
- Documentation: Existing .codebase_explanation.md remains accurate; no user-facing config changes required
