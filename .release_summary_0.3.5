### Changes

• Fixed AttributeError in chart sensors - timestamps now properly converted to datetime objects
• Reduced 502 API error logging from WARNING to DEBUG level (these errors are common and expected)
• Chart sensors now correctly handle statistics database timestamps

### Technical Details

**Chart Sensor Fixes:**
- Fixed `ContactEnergyChartHourlySensor.async_update()` to convert timestamp floats to datetime before calling `.isoformat()`
- Fixed `ContactEnergyChartDailySensor.async_update()` to convert timestamp floats to datetime before calling `.date().isoformat()`
- Resolves `AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'isoformat'` and `'float' object has no attribute 'date'`

**API Error Logging:**
- 502 errors now logged at DEBUG level after retry exhaustion (was WARNING)
- Added specific handling for UnknownError exceptions in `async_get_usage()` to log at DEBUG level
- Only non-502 errors are logged at WARNING level after retries exhausted
- Reduces log spam from Contact Energy API's frequent temporary unavailability

### User Impact

- Chart sensors now work correctly without errors
- Much cleaner logs - 502 errors only visible when debug logging is enabled
- Better reliability for ApexCharts integration
