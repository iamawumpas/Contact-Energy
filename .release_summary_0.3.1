## Version 0.3.1 - Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Fixed
- **Race Condition**: Sensors no longer try to read coordinator data before first update completes
  - Added `available` property to sensor base classes
  - Sensors report as "unavailable" until coordinator successfully fetches data
  - Added guard checks in data accessors to prevent KeyError exceptions
  
- **Excessive Logging**: Removed unnecessary success/info logging
  - Coordinator no longer logs normal operations as warnings/errors
  - Removed debug logs from sensor property getters
  - Only actual failures are logged now

- **502 Error Handling**: Improved API retry logging
  - Retry attempts now logged at DEBUG level instead of WARNING
  - Only logs WARNING after all retries are exhausted
  - Results in much cleaner logs during temporary API issues

### Technical Changes
- Sensors wait for `async_config_entry_first_refresh()` before computing values
- Added `last_update_success` checks throughout sensor code
- Changed retry logging from WARNING to DEBUG in `_request()` method
- Removed numerous debug/info logs that cluttered Home Assistant logs

### User Impact
- Cleaner logs with only relevant error messages
- No more "No account_details found" or "No matching contract found" errors on startup
- Sensors briefly show "Unavailable" on startup, then populate normally
- 502 API errors only show warnings after retries fail (not on every attempt)
