### Changes

Critical hotfix for coordinator data flow issue preventing sensors from receiving API data.

Urgent coordinator fixes:
• Enhanced coordinator debugging to track data flow from API to sensors
• Fixed coordinator exception handling that was silently failing and returning empty data
• Changed datetime.now() to datetime.utcnow() to avoid potential timezone issues
• Added comprehensive error logging throughout coordinator execution path
• Made coordinator more robust by continuing even if account details are missing
• Elevated debug messages to warnings/errors for better visibility during troubleshooting

This hotfix addresses the core issue where API calls succeed but sensors receive empty coordinator data, causing persistent "Unknown" values despite successful API responses.
