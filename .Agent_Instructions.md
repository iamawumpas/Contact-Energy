The agent will never commit any changes unless I tell it to

I am using the latest version of Home Assistant Core 2025.12.5

the agent, when requested will write a detailed changelog for the any commit. This will NOT use files differences, but use the discussion between the agent and me to write Human Friendly information. The purpose of the changelog is to inform the user and the agent of the changes and why they were made.

When requested the agent will update the github release tag with the specified version number and it will use the changelog entry for that version in the github release summary. Both the changelog and summary are to be identical.

you will always suggest changes then wait for me to approve them. When approved you will directly change the appropriate files.

Each piece of written code will also have a human friendly explanation written as a comment in the code.

The code should be optimised for the fastest execution

the agent will use the instrutions in https://developers.home-assistant.io/ to guide code design

the agent will use the .API_instructions.md in this codespace to guide code development to access the Contact Energy API.

whenever the agent is not sure what I am asking it will stop an ask questions

all instrutions to a user for entering data such as account details and passwords should be in human friendly detail. Update strings.json and en.json appropriately

RELEASE.SH
The purpose of the script is to quickly automate the commit process and update the integration version numbers and changelog entries.

**Script Usage:**
```bash
./release.sh x.y.z
```
Where `x.y.z` is the version number to be applied (e.g., `0.0.2`).

**Changelog Format:**
The Changelog.md file uses the following format with proper spacing:
```markdown
## [ x.y.z ]

### Added
- Item 1
- Item 2

### Fixed
- Item 1

## [ x.y.w ]
```

Note: The version header MUST be formatted as `## [ x.y.z ]` with spaces inside the brackets. Content between version headers is automatically extracted for the GitHub release summary.

**Script Workflow:**
1. **Changelog Generation**: The script will pause and instruct the user to ask the agent to write the changelog entry for the specified version. The changelog entry should be added to Changelog.md using the format `## [ x.y.z ]` followed by subsections (Added, Fixed, Changed, etc.).
2. **Version Updates**: The script automatically updates all version numbers with the same version number in:
   - README.md (in the version badge: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-x.y.z-blue.svg))
   - manifest.json (version field)
   - HACS.json (version field)
3. **Git Commit**: The script commits all staged files with the message "Release vx.y.z".
4. **Git Tag**: Creates a git tag named "vx.y.z" for the release.
5. **Push to Repository**: Automatically pushes both the commit and tag to the main branch.
6. **GitHub Release**: Creates a GitHub release with the version tag and automatically extracts and uses the changelog entry (content between `## [ x.y.z ]` and the next version header or end of file) as the release summary.

**Important Notes:**
- The changelog entry extraction is fully automated - any content between version headers is used as the release summary.
- No additional files are created when the script runs.
- No emails are sent when the commit is made.
- The script assumes staged files are ready to be committed.
- `release.sh` is excluded from HACS.json in the ignore list.
- Changes or modifications to `release.sh` are NOT included in changelog entries.
