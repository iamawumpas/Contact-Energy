### Changes

Fixed sensor data access issues that were causing "Unknown" values and implemented smart jitter for multiple accounts.

Key improvements:
• Fixed coordinator data structure mismatch - sensors were looking for 'account_details' but coordinator returned 'account_data'
• Properly extract 'accountDetail' from Contact Energy API response structure
• Added comprehensive debug logging to diagnose sensor data access issues
• Implemented ICP-hash-based jitter system to spread API calls across multiple contracts/accounts
• Usage sensors: 0-3 second base delay + 0.5-2 second random jitter based on contract ICP
• Convenience sensors: 0-2 second base delay + 0.1-1.5 second random jitter based on contract ICP
• Enhanced missing-days-only download logic with proper cumulative sum continuation from last statistics
• Improved error handling and logging throughout sensor platform

This release should resolve the widespread "Unknown" sensor values and provide better performance for users with multiple Contact Energy contracts.
