The agent will never commit any changes unless I tell it to

I am using the latest version of Home Assistant Core 2025.12.5

the agent, when requested will write a detailed changelog for the any commit. This will NOT use files differences, but use the discussion between the agent and me to write Human Friendly information. The purpose of the changelog is to inform the user and the agent of the changes and why they were made.

When requested the agent will update the github release tag with the specified version number and it will use the changelog entry for that version in the github release summary. Both the changelog and summary are to be identical.

you will always suggest changes then wait for me to approve them. When approved you will directly change the appropriate files.

Each piece of written code will also have a human friendly explanation written as a comment in the code.

The code should be optimised for the fastest execution

the agent will use the instrutions in https://developers.home-assistant.io/ to guide code design

the agent will use the .API_instructions.md in this codespace to guide code development to access the Contact Energy API.

whenever the agent is not sure what I am asking it will stop an ask questions

all instrutions to a user for entering data such as account details and passwords should be in human friendly detail. Update strings.json and en.json appropriately

RELEASE.SH
The purpose of the script is to quickly automate the commit process and update the integration version numbers and changelog entries.

**Script Usage:**
```bash
./release.sh x.y.z
```
Where `x.y.z` is the version number to be applied (e.g., `0.0.2`).

**Changelog Format:**
The Changelog.md file uses the following format with proper spacing:
```markdown
## [ x.y.z ]

### Added
- Item 1
- Item 2

### Fixed
- Item 1

## [ x.y.w ]
```

Note: The version header MUST be formatted as `## [ x.y.z ]` with spaces inside the brackets. Content between version headers is automatically extracted for the GitHub release summary.

**Script Workflow:**
1. **Changelog Generation**: The script will pause and instruct the user to ask the agent to write the changelog entry for the specified version. The changelog entry should be added to Changelog.md using the format `## [ x.y.z ]` followed by subsections (Added, Fixed, Changed, etc.).
2. **Version Updates**: The script automatically updates all version numbers with the same version number in:
   - README.md (in the version badge: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-x.y.z-blue.svg))
   - manifest.json (version field)
   - HACS.json (version field)
3. **Git Commit**: The script commits all staged files with the message "Release vx.y.z".
4. **Git Tag**: Creates a git tag named "vx.y.z" for the release.
5. **Push to Repository**: Automatically pushes both the commit and tag to the main branch.
6. **GitHub Release**: Creates a GitHub release with the version tag and automatically extracts and uses the changelog entry (content between `## [ x.y.z ]` and the next version header or end of file) as the release summary.

**Important Notes:**
- The changelog entry extraction is fully automated - any content between version headers is used as the release summary.
- No additional files are created when the script runs.
- No emails are sent when the commit is made.
- The script assumes staged files are ready to be committed.
- `release.sh` is excluded from HACS.json in the ignore list.
- Changes or modifications to `release.sh` are NOT included in changelog entries.

## 📚 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FILES

**⚠️ READ THESE FILES REGULARLY - THEY CONTAIN ESSENTIAL PROJECT CONTEXT**

### Primary Reference Documents
1. **[.usage_download_tasks.md](.usage_download_tasks.md)** - Detailed implementation tasks for usage data feature
   - Phase-by-phase breakdown (v1.4.x → v2.0.0)
   - API specifications and cache structure
   - Testing criteria and success metrics
   - **READ THIS:** Before starting any usage feature work, when resuming work after break, every 10 messages

2. **[.Agent_Instructions.md](.Agent_Instructions.md)** - This file
   - General development guidelines
   - Release process and automation
   - Code standards and documentation requirements
   - **READ THIS:** At start of session, when uncertain about process, every 15 messages

3. **[.API_instructions.md](.API_instructions.md)** - Contact Energy API documentation
   - Endpoint specifications
   - Authentication flow
   - Request/response formats
   - **READ THIS:** When implementing API calls, when debugging API issues

### 🔔 Reminder System

**AUTOMATIC REMINDERS:** The agent should re-read instruction files:
- **Every 10 messages** - Check `.usage_download_tasks.md` for current phase status
- **Every 15 messages** - Review `.Agent_Instructions.md` for process compliance
- **Before implementing new features** - Review relevant documentation
- **After user mentions "tasks" or "instructions"** - Immediately re-read both files
- **When starting a new session** - Read all three instruction files

**How to Track:** Maintain internal message counter and reference these files proactively.

### 📋 Quick Reference

| File | Purpose | Read When |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `.usage_download_tasks.md` | Usage feature implementation plan | Every 10 msgs, before coding, when resuming |
| `.Agent_Instructions.md` | Development process & standards | Every 15 msgs, when uncertain |
| `.API_instructions.md` | API technical specifications | When coding API calls |

**CURRENT PROJECT:** Usage Data Download Feature (Phase 1: v1.4.x)  
**PROTECTED VERSION:** v1.3.1 (stable branch: `stable-1.3.1`)  
**NEXT MILESTONE:** Phase 1 completion - API download & caching implementation

** release.sh
only the user can run release.sh. The agent cannot initiate this script. the user can instruct the agent to run the script from the chat window and the agent can run the script at that time.

** Changelog updates
the agent can only update/change the changelog when requested by release.sh or by the user instructing the agent to ammend.

** release.sh
do not add changes to the release.sh script tot he changelog. This a tool not part of the integration.

** wiki
if asked to update the wiki, update BOTH the wiki files and the online wiki for the repository. If not sure ask.
