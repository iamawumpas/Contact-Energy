### Changes

Critical bug fixes for duplicate entities and API timeout handling.

Urgent fixes:
• Fixed critical duplicate entity registration bug causing "cannot be added a second time" errors during integration setup
• Consolidated entity registration into single async_add_entities call to prevent conflicts
• Increased API timeout from 30s to 60s for usage data requests to handle slow Contact Energy servers
• Enhanced error handling for API timeouts and 504 Gateway Timeout errors with better logging
• Added graceful degradation - continue processing even if some days fail to download
• Improved statistics handling to save partial data when some API calls timeout

This release resolves the integration setup failures and provides better resilience against Contact Energy's API performance issues.
